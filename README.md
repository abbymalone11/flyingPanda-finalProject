# flyingPanda-finalProject
Final project for CS 120, altered Flappy Bird game
I wanted to make a game similar to Flappy Bird, but with some different animations. I used a panda on a jet pack instead of a flappy bird since pandas don't have flappy wings. For my obstacles, I decided to change them to bamboo to resemble a panda's habitat. Additionally, the rainforest in the back resembles a panda's home. I also added a score board that goes up by 100 everytime the panda passes through the bamboo. Lastly, there is an instruction page that allows you to hit play or quit to start the game. When the panda hits the bamboo, the game restarts and the score board resets as well.
Instructions: Hit "Play" on the start page to play the game, or "Quit" to end the game. Use the space key to move the panda through the bamboo. Once your panda has hit the bamboo, the game will start over.
I used the code from previous projects to add the instruction page and score board. I used images on google to find my new graphics and adobe to cut out the background.

During this project, I learned how to use simpleGE, how to edit images, and how to add an instruction page. I had to edit the panda to be using a jet pack and change the barriers to bamboo sticks, which I used picsart and adobe for. I originally struggled with the bamboo stick because it wasn't cropped enough to allow the panda through. I was ultimately able to fix that. I also struggled with getting my instruction page to display, but was able to fix that as well. I would like to be able to get my play button to work, which is what I'm stuck on and think would majorly improve my project. Next time, I would learn more about buttons, so that my project runs more smoothly. I had a lot of small changes to my game document because I did end up adding a timer, the panda doesn't move down, I decided to add a forest background instead of just a color, and there's no stop button at the bottom of the game. I stayed on track by keeping my graphics how I orignally wanted them and making the game similar to Flappy Bird.
